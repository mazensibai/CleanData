# Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

## Project Description

Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to run this course project

1. Create a ```Project``` folder on your computer.
2. Download the data source and extract the zip file into a folder. There will be a ```UCI HAR Dataset``` folder. Rename this folder to "dataset".
2. Put ```run_analysis.R``` in the root folder of ```Project```, then set it as your working directory using ```setwd()``` function in RStudio.
3. Run ```source("run_analysis.R")```, then it will generate a new file ```tiny_data.txt``` in your working directory.

## Library Dependencies

```run_analysis.R``` file will help you to install the dependencies automatically. It depends on ```reshape2``` and ```data.table```.
